# Star Citizen Patch Notes Discord Bot

A Discord bot that automatically fetches and posts the latest Star Citizen patch notes from the official Spectrum forum. It can also be manually triggered using the `/patchnotes` command. The bot uses Puppeteer for web scraping and ChatGPT (via OpenAI API) to format the patch notes for better readability.

## Features

- **Automatic Updates**: Fetches and posts new patch notes as soon as they are published.
- **Manual Trigger**: Use the `/patchnotes` command to fetch and post the latest patch notes at any time.
- **ChatGPT Integration**: Formats patch notes for clarity and readability.
- **Role Mention**: Pings a specific role (e.g., `@Patch Updates`) when new patch notes are posted.

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) installed on your system.
- **A Discord Bot Token** from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- **An OpenAI API Key** from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup/).
- **A Discord Server** where the bot will be deployed.
